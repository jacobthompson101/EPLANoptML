Machine learning as a surrogate model for EnergyPLAN and EPLANopt: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2024.132735
EPLANoptML is an innovative approach that integrates machine learning algorithms with EnergyPLAN and EPLANopt to accelerate energy system optimization at the country level. This model significantly reduces computational time while maintaining high accuracy, enabling more comprehensive exploration of uncertainties in energy system modeling.

## Features

- Integration of machine learning with EnergyPLAN and EPLANopt
- Significant reduction in computational time (64-74% faster than traditional EPLANopt)
- Maintains high accuracy (>99%) in predicting EnergyPLAN outputs
- Enables deeper exploration of energy system uncertainties
- Applicable to national-scale energy system modeling
- Preserves high temporal resolution and extensive sector-coupling

## Requirements

- EnergyPLAN version >=15.1 (Download from [EnergyPLAN website](https://www.energyplan.eu/))
- Python 3.x

## How to Use

Please look at [EPLANopt](https://github.com/matpri/EPLANopt) for more details on how to use this code.
